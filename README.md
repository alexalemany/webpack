# Webpack-Config
A basic frontend **webpack config, -eslint, babel 7**. This package works as a dependency for your project.

There is a three kind of enviorment modes: Production, Development and Watch

To start working on you need to add into your project:

`webpack.config.js` file with:
```javascript

const webpack = require('webpack-config/webpack.config.js')
const path = require('path')

webpack.entry = {
	// name and input entry of your file
	'name-of-your-output-file-name': '@/src/js/input-file-name.js',
}

webpack.output = {
	filename: 'js/[name].js',
	chunkFilename: 'js/[name].js',
	path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'path-to-your-ouput-folder'),
}

module.exports = webpack
```

`package.json` file:
```javascript
// ...
"scripts": {
	"watch": "npm run development -- --watch",
	"dev": "npm run development",
	"development": "webpack --mode development --config=webpack.config.js",
	"prod": "npm run production",
	"production": "webpack --mode production --config webpack.config.js"
},
"devDependencies": {
    "webpack-config": "git@github.com:alexalemany/webpack-config.git#semver:~v1.x.x"
}
// ...
```

Add proper configuration to visual studio to parse files with eslint plugin:

```javascript
// ...
"eslint.options": {
	"configFile": "./node_modules/webpack-config/.eslintrc"
},
// ...
```

This package works with:
- **SCSS**
- **BABEL 7**
- **BABEL LOADER with standard presets**

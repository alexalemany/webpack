	// name and input entry of your file
	// this first js is a alias js/src/js/input-file-name.js
	'name-of-your-output-file-name': 'js/src/js/input-file-name.js',
}

webpack.output = {
	filename: 'js/[name].js',
	chunkFilename: 'js/[name].js',
	path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'path-to-your-ouput-folder'),
}

module.exports = webpack
```

`package.json` file:
```javascript
// ...
"scripts": {
	"dev": "npm run development",
	"development": "webpack --mode development --config=webpack.config.js --display-error-details",
	"watch": "npm run development -- --watch",
